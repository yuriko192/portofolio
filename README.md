# Ivan's Portfolio

Site: [https://ivan19.netlify.app/](https://ivan19.netlify.app/)

Personal portfolio site, currently built using Sveltekit

## Developing

Make a new branch, and create a PR to the master

To run the local dev environment, run one of these command
```bash
npm run dev # to access from a single device
# OR
npm run devHost # to access from another device in the network
```

The beta site will then be accessible in [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)

once the PR is merged it will be deployed to [the site](https://ivan19.netlify.app/)
